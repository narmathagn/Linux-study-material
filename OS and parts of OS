Operating system:
================
An operating system or OS is a software program that enables the computer hardware to communicate 
and operate with the computer software. Without a computer operating system, a computer and software 
programs would be useless. 
An operating system (sometimes abbreviated as "OS") is the program that, after being initially loaded into 
the computer by a boot program, manages all the other programs in a computer. The other programs are 
called applications or application programs. The application programs make use of the operating system 
by making requests for services through a defined application program interface (API). In addition, users 
can interact directly with the operating system through a user interface such as a command language or a 
graphical user interface (GUI).
An operating system performs these services for applications:
 In a multitasking operating system where multiple programs can be running at the same time, 
the operating system determines which applications should run in what order and how much 
time should be allowed for each application before giving another application a turn.
 It manages the sharing of internal memory among multiple applications.
 It handles input and output to and from attached hardware devices, such as hard disks, printers, 
and dial-up ports. 
 It sends messages to each application or interactive user (or to a system operator) about the status 
of operation and any errors that may have occurred.
 It can offload the management of what are called batch jobs (for example, printing) so that the 
initiating application is freed from this work.
 On computers that can provide parallel processing, an operating system can manage how to 
divide the program so that it runs on more than one processor at a time.
Examples of computer operating systems
 Redhat – Very popular Linux operating system from Redhat 
 Microsoft Windows - PC and IBM compatible operating system. Microsoft Windows is the most 
commonly found and used operating system in PCs
 Apple MacOS - Apple computer operating system. The only Apple computer operating system.
 Ubuntu Linux - A popular variant of Linux used with PC and IBM compatible computers.
 Google Android - operating system used with Android compatible phones.
 iOS - Operating system used with the Apple iPhone.

Various Parts of an Operating System:
=====================================
UNIX and 'UNIX-like' operating systems (such as Linux) consist of a kernel and some system programs. 
There are also some application programs for doing work. The kernel is the heart of the operating system. 
In fact, it is often mistakenly considered to be the operating system itself, but it is not. An operating 
system provides many more services than a plain kernel.
It keeps track of files on the disk, starts programs and runs them concurrently, assigns memory and other 
resources to various processes, receives packets from and sends packets to the network, and so on. The 
kernel does very little by itself, but it provides tools with which all services can be built. It also prevents 
anyone from accessing the hardware directly, forcing everyone to use the tools it provides. This way the 
kernel provides some protection for users from each other. The tools provided by the kernel are used via 
system calls. 
The system programs use the tools provided by the kernel to implement the various services required 
from an operating system. System programs, and all other programs, run `on top of the kernel', in what is 
called the user mode. The difference between system and application programs is one of intent: 
applications are intended for getting useful things done (or for playing, if it happens to be a game), 
whereas system programs are needed to get the system working. A word processor is an application; 
mount is a system program. The difference is often somewhat blurry, however, and is important only to 
compulsive categorizers.
An operating system can also contain compilers and their corresponding libraries (GCC and the C library 
in particular under Linux), although not all programming languages need be part of the operating 
system. Documentation, and sometimes even games, can also be part of it. 
Important parts of the kernel
The Linux kernel consists of several important parts: 
 Process management
 Memory management
 Hardware device drivers
 Filesystem drivers
 Network management
 Various other bits and pieces
The following figure shows some of the more important parts of the Linux kernel
Probably the most important parts of the kernel (nothing else works without them) are memory 
management and process management. Memory management takes care of assigning memory areas and 
swap space areas to processes, parts of the kernel, and for the buffer cache. Process management creates 
processes, and implements multitasking by switching the active process on the processor.
At the lowest level, the kernel contains a hardware device driver for each kind of hardware it supports. 
Since the world is full of different kinds of hardware, the number of hardware device drivers is large. 
There are often many otherwise similar pieces of hardware that differ in how they are controlled by 
software. The similarities make it possible to have general classes of drivers that support similar 
operations; each member of the class has the same interface to the rest of the kernel but differs in what it 
needs to do to implement them. For example, all disk drivers look alike to the rest of the kernel, i.e., they 
all have operations like `initialize the drive', `read sector N', and `write sector N'.
