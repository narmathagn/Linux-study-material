Hard Disk:
=========
A hard disk is part of a unit, often called a "disk drive," "hard drive," or "hard disk drive," that stores and 
provides relatively quick access to large amounts of data on an electromagnetically charged surface or set 
of surfaces. Today's computers typically come with a hard disk that contains several billion bytes 
(gigabytes) of storage. 
A hard disk is really a set of stacked "disks," each of which, like phonograph records, has data recorded 
electromagnetically in concentric circles or "tracks" on the disk. A "head" (something like a phonograph 
arm but in a relatively fixed position) records (writes) or reads the information on the tracks. Two heads, 
one on each side of a disk, read or write the data as the disk spins. Each read or write operation requires 
that data be located, which is an operation called a "seek." (Data already in a disk cache, however, will be 
located more quickly.) 
A hard disk/drive unit comes with a set rotation speed varying from 4500 to 7200 rpm. Disk access time is 
measured in milliseconds. Although the physical location can be identified with cylinder, track, and 
sector locations, these are actually mapped to a logical block address (LBA) that works with the larger 
address range on today's hard disks.

Disk Cache:
==========
A disk cache is a mechanism for improving the time it takes to read from or write to a hard disk. Today, 
the disk cache is usually included as part of the hard disk. A disk cache can also be a specified portion of 
random access memory (RAM). 
The disk cache holds data that has recently been read and, in some cases, adjacent data areas that are 
likely to be accessed next. Write caching is also provided with some disk caches.
